# AWS Signed PDF Download

This plugin will enable a wordpress user to sign a URL to access 
private content behind an Amazon CloudFront distribution.

Create a key pair and configure the CloudFront distribution appropriately 
as well as in this plugin and then you can use the shortcode [wp-sign-pdf] 
to denote a URL to be signed.  You can also wrap the URL with tags 
[wp-sign-pdf]my-url[/wp-sign-pdf].

Full details of the generation of the keypair and configuration of AWS can 
be found in the 
[AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html)

This plugin does not manage the process of getting Media Assets on to Amazon 
S3 or modify the Domain name for AWS based media - nor will it work for 
streaming media such as HLS video as all of the subassets need also to 
be signed and not just the manifest file.
